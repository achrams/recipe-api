# Recipe API

## Project Overview
The Recipe API is a powerful and flexible API that allows users to manage and access recipes stored in a PostgreSQL database using Sequelize ORM and Express.js. It provides a RESTful interface to perform operations on recipe data, and it's built with best practices for structuring a web application.

## Installation
To install the Recipe API, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/recipe-api.git
   cd recipe-api
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and set up your environment variables based on your database configuration.

## Usage
To start the application in development mode, run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

For a production environment, use:
```bash
npm start
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port defined in your environment). You can now interact with the endpoints to create, read, update, and delete recipes.

## Features
- Create, read, update, and delete recipes.
- User authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- Password hashing with bcrypt for secure storage.
- Support for CORS to allow cross-origin requests.
- Configuration management with environment variables using dotenv.

## Dependencies
The project has several dependencies, as specified in `package.json`, including:
- `express`: A fast web framework for Node.js.
- `sequelize`: A promise-based Node.js ORM for SQL databases.
- `pg`: PostgreSQL client for Node.js.
- `dotenv`: Module to load environment variables from a `.env` file.
- `jsonwebtoken`: To implement JWT for authentication.
- `bcrypt`: For hashing passwords.
- `cors`: Middleware for enabling CORS.

### Development Dependencies
- `nodemon`: A tool to automatically restart the server during development.
- `sequelize-cli`: Command line interface for Sequelize.
